Yesterday, I received an untitled email with email id as xyz@yahoo.com, and I thought it was spam; I didn't open it. The following day, I received another mail from jeff with the email id as jeff245@gmail.com, and from there, I found out that It was just a reminder from the bank for the loan dues. rajnish@gmail.com .
